And a real photographer wont use a phone for taking photographs, he probably owns a Go-pro for action shots and a DSLR for other Photos. I own an Iphone 6s, and I've never used the 3D touch feature.(I find it useless) The phone is so thin, I don't get it. Its like you have to buy a thick cover in order to feel that it is in your hand and that it doesn't slip off the moment you take it out of your pocket. I mean sure, its so expensive that the person who owns one can show off with it: \n\nX: Damn bruh I got myself and Iphone\nY: Damn you so riccch\nMe: Whats the point in spending so much money over an apple, I mean get better shit for cheap. Even their laptops are shit. I'm just saying, I wouldn't spend money to buy a phone so I could tell the public that I'm rich in an indirect way.\n\nPlus whats the point? I mean, every year there is like a new Iphone which is basically the same thing with a better processor. For the Iphone X, Face recognition seriously? How the fuck is someone gonna unlock the phone if he/she is in an emergency situation and he/she has Siri disabled? He/she would probably get killed before his/her Iphone recognises his/her sweaty face(Sweat due to panic). They should have kept the Fingerprint scanner.\n\nAnyways, this is my opinion.

I own an Iphone 6s, and I've never used the 3D touch feature.(I find it useless) The phone is so thin, I don't get it. Its like you have to buy a thick cover in order to feel that it is in your hand and that it doesn't slip off the moment you take it out of your pocket. I mean sure, its so expensive that the person who owns one can show off with it: \n\nX: Damn bruh I got myself and Iphone\nY: Damn you so riccch\nMe: Whats the point in spending so much money over an apple, I mean get better shit for cheap. Even their laptops are shit. I'm just saying, I wouldn't spend money to buy a phone so I could tell the public that I'm rich in an indirect way.\n\nPlus whats the point? I mean, every year there is like a new Iphone which is basically the same thing with a better processor. For the Iphone X, Face recognition seriously? How the fuck is someone gonna unlock the phone if he/she is in an emergency situation and he/she has Siri disabled? He/she would probably get killed before his/her Iphone recognises his/her sweaty face(Sweat due to panic). They should have kept the Fingerprint scanner.\n\nAnyways, this is my opinion.

397022,aawlU1IzuqI,Wireless charging is a waste and a gimmick for now. You can't functionally use your phone because it has to lay down on the mat. \n\nThe only benefit I see is being able to listen to music  with your headphones while it's charging but that's a feature you had out the box and didn't have to pay extra for on past iPhones smh.,0,0,-0.017592592592592604,0.3773148148148148
397023,aawlU1IzuqI,I'm so disappointed that a fast charger is not included in 2017. I don't understand how Apple devices are ahead in some places and way back compared to other devices. There are people who support Apple and they're not sheeps just for the Apple logo. I came to an end with their sh1ty policies. That's enough.,0,0,-0.135,0.445
