Even their laptops are shit. I'm just saying, I wouldn't spend money to buy a phone so I could tell the public that I'm rich in an indirect way.\n\nPlus whats the point? I mean, every year there is like a new Iphone which is basically the same thing with a better processor. For the Iphone X, Face recognition seriously? How the fuck is someone gonna unlock the phone if he/she is in an emergency situation and he/she has Siri disabled?
